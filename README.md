This is the talk I gave at [DjangoCon US 2016](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/54/). The "slides" are at https://mjumbewu.github.io/cyborg-city-presentation. To prepare for the talk I hosted a series of dinners where we discussed the future of several social topics. The repo with nores and prep work for those is at https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity.
