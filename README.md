This is the talk I gave at [DjangoCon US 2016](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/54/) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ8hTztakTk)). The "slides" are at https://mjumbewu.github.io/cyborg-city-presentation (use right/left arrow keys to advance) and the speakers notes/script is [here](https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborg-city-presentation/blob/gh-pages/SCRIPT.md) (now with slide progression annotations!).

To prepare for the talk I hosted a series of dinners where we discussed the future of several social topics. The repo with notes and prep work for those is at https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity. I also spoke about the prepatation process at Ignite Philly 19 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fSRuqfsirU)).
